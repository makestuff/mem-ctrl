--------------------------- SIMPLE SDRAM CONTROLLER ----------------------------

A simple SDRAM controller, which just does single word reads and writes. The
refresh cycles can be scheduled automatically, or they may be explicitly
requested by external logic. The advantage of the former is simplicity; the
advantage of the latter is the possibility of deterministic read/write latency.
